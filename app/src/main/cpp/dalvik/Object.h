/*
 * There are three types of objects:
 *  Class objects - an instance of java.lang.Class
 *  Array objects - an object created with a "new array" instruction
 *  Data objects - an object that is neither of the above
 *
 * We also define String objects.  At present they're equivalent to
 * DataObject, but that may change.  (Either way, they make some of the
 * code more obvious.)
 *
 * All objects have an Object header followed by type-specific data.
